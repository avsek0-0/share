Place the following files here (self-hosted so QR works without CDNs):

1) qrcode.min.js  (from https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/qrcode@1.5.3/build/qrcode.min.js or https://unpkg.com/qrcode@1.5.3/build/qrcode.min.js)
2) jsQR.js        (from https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/jsqr@1.4.0/dist/jsQR.js or https://unpkg.com/jsqr@1.4.0/dist/jsQR.js)

After adding the files, commit & push. The service worker will cache them for offline use.
